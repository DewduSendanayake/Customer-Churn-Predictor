# 💔 Pastel Churn Predictor

> Predict customer churn with elegance, intelligence, and just the right touch of pastel.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Pastel Churn Predictor** is a visually captivating and machine learning–powered web application built with **Streamlit**. It leverages a trained **XGBoost model** to calculate churn risk probabilities for telecom customers based on key features such as tenure, monthly charges, and customer relationships.

This project blends **technical rigor** with **artistic UI/UX design**, transforming churn prediction into an intuitive, soft-toned user experience.
